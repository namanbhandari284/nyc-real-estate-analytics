We build upon the insights gained from our previous real estate market analysis to develop robust forecasting models on our neighborhoods. Since we were not able to select the best neighborhood to open a new branch office in Assignment 3, we decided to run time series models for prediction on all eight neighborhoods in this assignment, then select the optimal one. Utilizing data spanning from 2003 to 2021, we will apply advanced predictive analytics techniques using R/RStudio to forecast the future revenue potential of this neighborhood.
Our primary objective is to create time series forecasting models that accurately predict the revenue potential for the years 2022 to 2025. To achieve this, we will prepare our dataset for time series analysis, ensuring the data is in the appropriate format and granularity. We will explore and apply various forecasting methods, starting with Exponential Smoothing. This approach will help us understand and incorporate the patterns of error, trend, and seasonality/cyclicality that are characteristic of the real estate market.
Additionally, we will delve into an optional but valuable component of our analysis: building a linear regression model to further forecast revenue potential. This model will consider various predictors, including time factors and lagged values of relevant KPIs, to enhance the accuracy of our predictions. We chose to analyze single exponential, double exponential and triple exponential to find the best model by some factors.
Throughout this assignment, we will maintain a high standard of data processing and model development. Our results will be meticulously documented and presented in a professional format, suitable for academic and practical applications. This assignment will not only contribute to our understanding of time series forecasting and regression modeling but also equip us with the skills to make data-driven decisions in the dynamic field of real estate analytics. Our findings will be pivotal in guiding the strategic decision to open a branch office in the chosen neighborhood, illustrating the power of predictive analytics in real estate.
